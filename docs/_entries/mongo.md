### Mongo DB

MongoDB (from humongous) is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc., and is published under a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License.

It is a way for us to store the data in a JSON format and pull the data from the database in a ready to use format.

A NoSQL database is also perfect for this scenario as there is no need for relational tables and the additional overhead can be avoided.
